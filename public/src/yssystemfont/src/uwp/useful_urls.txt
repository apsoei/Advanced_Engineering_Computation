WritableBitmap, TextBlock, RenderTargetBitmap were not a correct answer.  The correct answer was Win2D.

https://code.msdn.microsoft.com/windowsapps/Render-text-on-bitmap-fff2b406
  -> WritableBitmap?  RenderTargetBitmap?
  -> TextBlock
     https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/apps/windows.ui.xaml.controls.textblock.aspx

Do I have to render to RenderTargetBitmap and then convert to a format that I can access pixel values?

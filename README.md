# CMU Advanced Engineering Computation: Fun applications from problem sets!

## By Jae seok Oh

## Public, MML libraries provided by Professor Soji Yamakawa. CMU.

## Requirements and building

- CMake , C++ compiler.

- TO BUILD (example ps1): In current directory (top-level)

`mkdir build`

`cd build`

`cmake ../jaeseoko/ps1/`

In the following, target could be ps # or main. Refer to CMakeLists.txt.

`cmake --build . --config Release --target main`

- To run executable (example ps1): In Mac OS

`./ps1.app/Contents/MacOS/ps1`

### Description

## PS 1, 2 - Cannonball game , Bouncing ball simulation (CMAKE practice)

## PS 3 - Flythrough , Jump game with MM

## PS 4 - Bitmap application + Hashtable

### Using Hastable: Move bitmap, identify unique tiles, and replace characters with backgrounds by finding similar tiles.
